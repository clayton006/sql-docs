# PDO::rollback
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

Discards database commands that were issued after calling [PDO::beginTransaction](../../connect/php/pdo-begintransaction.md) and returns the connection to auto commit mode.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
bool PDO::rollBack ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
true if the method call succeeded, false otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
PDO::rollback is not affected by (and does not affect) the value of PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT.  
  
See [PDO::beginTransaction](../../connect/php/pdo-begintransaction.md) for an example that uses PDO::rollback.  
  
Support for PDO was added in version 2.0 of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)].
